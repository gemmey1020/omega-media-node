# Ω-MEDIA-NODE — MASTER SEAL v1
## Canonical Boundary & Stability Contract

> "From the void, structure emerges.
> From structure, clarity.
> From clarity, control."

---

## IDENTIFIER

- Seal ID: Ω-MEDIA-NODE-BOUNDARIES-v1
- Status: FINAL / LOCKED
- Scope: Media Node (Public Gateway)
- Version: v1.0.0
- Authority: Omega Architecture

---

## DEFINITION

Ω-Media-Node is a **stateless, deterministic, public-facing identity gateway**.

It is:
- A surface
- A router
- A presenter

It is NOT:
- A system
- A brain
- A tracker
- A decision engine

---

## MODE MATRIX (LOCKED)

The Media Node operates under exactly five modes:

- SILENT (default)
- CONTACT
- BUSINESS
- FOUNDER
- INTERNAL (LOCKED)

No additional modes are permitted in v1.

Mode selection is deterministic and happens **before rendering**.

No behavior can change the active mode.

---

## BEHAVIOR SURFACE (LOCKED)

Allowed behaviors are strictly limited to:

- B → Button Click
- R → Reservation Submit
- N → Newsletter Subscribe
- C → Contact Submit

Rules:
- No passive tracking
- No implicit behaviors
- No hidden events
- No behavioral inference

Each mode allows only its predefined behaviors.
No behavior escalation is permitted.

---

## ABSOLUTE BOUNDARIES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The Media Node will NEVER:

1. Make decisions
2. Analyze humans
3. Track silently
4. Store data (cookies, sessions, localStorage)
5. Contain feedback loops
6. Communicate directly with backend services
7. Optimize for conversion
8. Act as a business tool
9. Evolve silently
10. Break determinism

Same input → Same mode → Same output.
Always.

---

## SIGNAL POLICY

- The Media Node does not track.
- The Media Node may emit **explicit signals only**.
- Signals are one-way.
- No response is expected or handled.

All signal handling belongs to external modules (e.g. BRNC++).

---

## VERSIONING & CHANGE CONTROL

- Any violation of this seal requires a new major version.
- No hotfixes.
- No temporary exceptions.
- No silent edits.

---

## FINAL DECLARATION

This seal declares Ω-Media-Node v1 as **architecturally stable**.

From this point forward:
- Media Node is immutable.
- BRNC++ may be designed **based on this reality**, not assumptions.
